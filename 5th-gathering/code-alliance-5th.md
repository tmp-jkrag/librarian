Note:

In Praqma we strive to practice the _buy a man - get a team_ approach with every customer. Consequently, every customer should ideally know more Praqma employees than just the usual suspects that helps them on a daily basis.

The Code Alliance is a means for that - that's why we prioritize to send so many of our own people

Create it<br/><!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Deliver it<br/><!-- .element class="fragment" -->

>>>>NEWSLIDE

## Get an idea

Ideas come from multiple sources, but always from the same causes:

__Someone identified a genuine problem,<br/>that can be solved with software__

Most ideas originates from you. Being ambitious as your are, you continuously strive to improve your processes and occasionally that requires more software.<!-- .element class="fragment"  -->

Note:

Ideas come and go every day. The ones that are any good, are captured as informal issues on the repository, where the will end up being implemented if they ever get to that point.

>>>>NEWSLIDE

## Describe it
## Evolve it

The first description of an idea is usually captured as an issue labeled "briefing" in a GitHub repository

__A briefing is a _size zero_ issue - no one is working on it yet.<br/>We're discussing it__

Everyone has access to contribute to the briefing, and that is how it evolves.<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note:
This part for the process serves the important purpose, of ensuring that the problem described _really_ is generic and _really_ is one that shall be solved using software (as opposed to common sense or a sprinkle og DORITH)

>>>>NEWSLIDE

## Distill it
## Fund it

When an idea is evolved enough it's time to define it as a deliverable

__We use a _Statement of Work_ to define<br/>the _Minumum Viable Product___

The quote in the SoW is fixed price. Work is initiated when it's fully funded<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note:
The MVP is typically scoped as a relatively small project ( < 100 hours estimate). The price is fixed to make it easier to fund. The project is small to enable us to manage the risk of offering fixed price.

>>>>NEWSLIDE

## Create it

Task are created from the SoW, each commit is approved in the pipeline and stored in an Open Source repository

__The primary measure of progress is running code__

Stakeholders have access to install, run and try-out through the entire process<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note:
We use a Kanban approach during development. The process is 100% transparent to all stakeholders, and we often make many actual deployments and try-outs at the customer, during the development process.

>>>>NEWSLIDE

## Deliver it

The product will be available, documented and deployable from it's location on GitHub

__Features are guaranteed__

The product will be continuously maintained an delivered from the same location - as Open Source<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

Note:

The maintenance and further development is typically done either in relative small chunks, each individually funded by the individual requester or as large time and material projects.

## 2Git
### Git migration ...as code

2git is a Groovy DSL, a small language that is designed to migrate your code [2git](http://www.2git.io).

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

You write your migration recipe and feed it into the 2git engine, which will then execute your migration, resulting in your git repository.

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

If you don’t like what you see, you can easily tweak your recipe and run it again, until you get the perfect migration.
